# Two-Sided-Platform
> A simulation of a platform ecosystem, specifically a two-sided marketplace, in which participants can play the role of platform administrator,
make a variety of decisions that have direct consequences for the users (i.e., consumers and producers).
<!-- Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). -->

## General Information
- A two-sided marketplace is replicated and the user is able to act as an adminstartor in the system, capable of adjusting different controls like, pricing policies, advertisments, and membership rules. All changes a user makes dynamically adjusts both sides of the marketplace, demonstarting key cross-side effects.
- Such a simulation will allow for the systematic study of the attitudes, decisions, and behaviors of individuals
enacting various roles in a platform organization.
- This simulation was created for an on-going study at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used
- Chart.js - version 3.5.0

## Usage
As of now, to run the simulation, obtain the zip file, extract all files, and open 'welcome.html' to get started.
To edit variable/control names, open 'names.js' in a text-editor of your choice.
